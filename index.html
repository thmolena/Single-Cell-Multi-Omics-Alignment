        <p>In this project, I designed novel supervised algorithms to perform cell-to-cell alignment for single-cell multi-omic datasets.

            <button onclick="window.location.href='https://rsinghlab.github.io/SCOT/data/'">Datasets</button> 
            <p> The datasets were originally used for the SCOT model in the "Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics data" paper from Singh Lab at Brown University CCMB in 2020. 
            
        <p> I also performed a side-by-side comparison with the SCOT model to show that my adaptive supervised model perform better
            alignment. A demo of my adaptive supervised algorithm can be found below.
